<h1> N-Matrix Tic Tac Toe</h1>
<h3> A classic Tic Tac Toe experience with some twists.</h3>

A modifiable NxN Matrix Tic Tac Toe written in C++.

- ADDED: It comes with a toggle to view the matrix as a weave fabric-like aesthetic for grid structure. (I added it because I felt it was fun)
- ADDED: Grid numbers for assistance for large grids.
- BY DEFAULT: A 3x3 grid with Weave Aesthetic turned off.
